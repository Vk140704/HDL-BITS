Problem Statement
We're going to start with a small bit of HDL to get familiar with the interface used by HDLBits. Here's the description of the circuit you need to build for this exercise:

Build a circuit with no inputs and one output. That output should always drive 1 (or logic high).

ANSWER:
module top_module( output one );

// Insert your code here
    assign one = 1;
// assign one =1'b1;
endmodule
